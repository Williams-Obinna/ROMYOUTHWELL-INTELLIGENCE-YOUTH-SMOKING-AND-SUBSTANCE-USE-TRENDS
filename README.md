## Introduction

**Objective**  
To analyze youth behavioral patterns, especially smoking and drug use, in relation to mental health and social variables such as media influence, socioeconomic status, and parental supervision.

**Problem Statement**  
Many young people face overlapping challenges—mental health decline, substance abuse, and inadequate support systems. This project explores how these factors are interrelated and how stakeholders can address them.

## Key Research Questions

- Which age group has the highest smoking prevalence?
- How does mental health correlate with smoking and drug use?
- What impact does socioeconomic status have on drug use?
- How influential is media exposure on youth behavior?
- Are there gender disparities in supervision and drug use?
- Does counseling access improve mental health outcomes?

## Methodology

**Tools Used in Excel**  
- Pivot Tables for segmented analysis  
- VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH for data merging  
- AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS for conditional calculations  
- Conditional Formatting for threshold identification  
- Manual data cleaning and header standardization

**Data Source**  
- Collected via web scraping  
- Originates from public datasets hosted on Kaggle

## Summary of Findings

- Mental health scores peaked in 2023 (5.52), followed by a decline in 2024.
- Youth aged 0–14 had the highest smoking prevalence (28.09%).
- Individuals identifying as "both" genders had the highest drug experimentation rate (40.48%).
- Low-income groups had the highest average drug use (40.33%).
- Counseling access was highest among youth aged 20–24.
- Females reported lower parental supervision (avg. 5.47).
- Media influence was surprisingly highest among adults aged 60–69.

## Recommendations

1. Maintain and expand mental health support programs.
2. Launch anti-smoking campaigns targeted at youth under age 15.
3. Increase access to counseling in underserved age groups (e.g., 25–29, 70–79).
4. Develop inclusive education strategies for all gender identities.
5. Support outreach programs in low socioeconomic communities.
6. Address the supervision gap between genders with family engagement strategies.
7. Tailor public messaging via media channels for older adults.

## Limitations

- Yearly data lacks finer granularity (no monthly/quarterly trends)
- Self-reported survey data may be subject to bias
- Some sheets had inconsistent headers or missing values
- Limited causal analysis due to Excel’s analytical scope

---

## Future Work

- Incorporate more granular (monthly) time-series data
- Add qualitative research such as interviews or focus groups
- Use advanced tools (e.g., Python, R) for predictive modeling
- Expand the dataset to include more regions for comparison

## How to Use

1. Open the `Dashboard For YouthWell.xlsx` to explore insights interactively.
2. Use slicers and pivot filters to view trends by age, gender, or income.
3. Refer to the visualizations folder for high-quality graphs.
4. Review the final observations in the `Final_Report.pdf` or `README.md`.
